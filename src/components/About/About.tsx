                      My name is Jonas and I live in Stockholm, Sweden with my
                      family. Although I am new to Front-end, I have a passion
                      for development and like the small details, both design
                      and semantically written code is something I value highly.

                    <h2>Education</h2>
                    <p>
                      I graduated in Frontend development in June 2023 at the
                      Mediainstitutet in Stockholm where I have learned mostly
                      how to work in React but also some in Angular. I also got
                      to try how it is to work backend with Node.js. During
                      school I had an internship at a startup company called
                      Buddywise. Their idea is to prevent workplace accidents
                      using AI and cameras. In the first part of my internship I
                      got to help finalise some parts of their user interface.
                      Here I learnt how to work with agile working methods and
                      work with Bootstrap. In addition to my everyday tasks, I
                      also participated in Tele2 Iot talks to promote Buddywise.
                      During my second internship, I further developed my thesis
                      work that I had done. It was a function that was developed
                      for Buddywise. An anonymisation feature to create a
                      Gaussian blur effect when a notification is sent to the
                      client. With this feature, every image that the client
                      receives remains anonymous and GDPR safe. <br />
